DistAlgo Tutorial:

This repository will host a short, practical introduction to the DistAlgo
language: a language designed for high-level implementation of distributed
algorithms.

This is mostly practice for writing introductory tutorials for new languages. I
am not the creator or maintainer of DistAlgo. DistAlgo is the work of Bo Lin,
Annie Liu, and Scott Stoller at Stony Brook University.

DistAlgo can be acquired at: https://github.com/DistAlgo/distalgo
